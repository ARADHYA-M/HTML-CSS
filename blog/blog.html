    <h2>The Art of Staying Consistent</h2>
    <h3>By Matthew Matte | November 4,2025</h3>
    <img src="consistency.jpeg">
    <p>Consistency is one of the most powerful habits you can build in life. Whether you're learning a new skill, improving your health, or working on a creative project, small daily actions add up to big results over time. It's not about perfection — it's about showing up even when motivation fades.</p>
    <p>In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to get distracted by quick results and lose focus when progress feels slow. But consistency teaches patience and builds resilience. Each time you choose to continue, even in small ways, you strengthen your discipline and move one step closer to your goal.</p>
    <p>Remember, success isn't created overnight — it's built quietly through steady effort and belief in your purpose. Stay patient, stay focused, and trust the process. The results will come when your habits and persistence align with your vision.</p>
