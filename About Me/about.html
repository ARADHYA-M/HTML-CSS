        <p>Hi, I'm Aradhya, a web development enthusiast with a strong interest in designing clean, user-friendly, and visually appealing websites. I enjoy exploring how small details in design and code can create a big impact on user experience.</p>
        <p>I love working with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m always eager to learn new tools and frameworks that make web development more efficient and creative. Building projects from scratch helps me understand both the technical and artistic sides of development.</p>
        <p>Beyond coding, I enjoy experimenting with design ideas, learning from real-world projects, and collaborating with others to bring creative concepts to life. My goal is to keep growing as a developer and create work that’s both functional and inspiring.</p>
        <p>I believe learning never stops — every project is an opportunity to improve, innovate, and express creativity. I’m motivated by challenges and inspired by how technology can connect people and ideas across the world.</p>
